# CIT300 Practical Assignment 2 – Data Sorter  
### Sorting Algorithm Comparison Tool

---

## 📘 Project Overview
This project is developed as part of **CIT300 – Data Structures and Algorithms** (Week 12).  
The **Data Sorter** is a console-based Java program that implements and compares multiple sorting algorithms — **Bubble Sort**, **Merge Sort**, and **Quick Sort** — based on their **execution time** and **step count** to demonstrate algorithmic complexity and performance differences.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Allow users to input a custom list of numbers or generate random data automatically.  
- Implement and compare three sorting algorithms:
  - Bubble Sort  
  - Merge Sort  
  - Quick Sort  
- Display the sorted outputs and performance metrics (time & steps).  
- Provide a menu-driven interface with validation for easy interaction.
